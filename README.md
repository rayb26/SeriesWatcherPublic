Public repository of my tv series alert web app, written mainly in Python, that notifies users when their tv series comes out asynchronously. Additionally, you can see what series are coming out soon. The architecture of this project is a web service and it has a backend service connecting to the IMDB REST API, two Firebase databases that the system puts ands reads data to, and contains the Flask MVC architecture. There is an asynchronous Python script running on the side (not on this repository) that pings the IMDB API daily and adds new titles to the coming soon page.
